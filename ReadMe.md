## Introduction

Our SDK allows you to select which features and functionality you need as well as to customize the look and feel of different UI elements. Customization can be performed via code level options and/or XML configuration.

The PrintIO SDK also offers the ability to send push notifications from your app. More information on configuration and usage can be found in the [Push Notifications](https://github.com/printdotio/printio-ios-sdk/blob/master/docs/PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS.md) documentation.
